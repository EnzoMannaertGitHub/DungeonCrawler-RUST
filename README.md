# DungeonCrawler-RUST

# Controls
- Arrow keys to move around
- G to grab an item
- 1 .. 9 to use item in corresponding slot

# The project
I started this project to learn more about the Rust programming language, which is rumored to be the future of game development.
I was guided by the "Hands-on Rust" book by Herbert Wolverson.
After finishing the book I had implemented a lot of features:

**FEATURES**
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- Turn based movement/combat
- various enemy types
- various item types (Dungeon Map, Healing Potion)
- Different type of dungeon generations (Cellular Automata, Drunken Miner, Basic Rooms)
- 3 Dungeon floors to explore before completing the game
- HUD

To test my knowledge of Rust I decided to add some features of my own.

**OWN FEATURES**
- Score system + Score display
- Highscore
- Freeze poition (freezes enemies for 2 turns)
- Dungeon traps (Tile with spikes)

# Conclusion

I have learned a lot about the Rust programming language and I am excited for the future. I will keep making various games with Rust but have decided to conclude this project.
